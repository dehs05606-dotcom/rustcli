"""Team — the shared worker-subagent substrate.

The parallel fan-out machinery is gone: every subagent now runs through
the persistent CREW (crew.py), which is the ONLY way to execute a worker.
This file keeps the pieces the whole system shares:

    ROLES               role -> tool whitelist + write permission
    WorkerReport        the compact structured report a worker collapses into
    parse_worker_final  split a worker's final STATUS/SUMMARY reply
    chat_with_retry     rate-limit-hardened model call (crew + evaluators)
    _WRITE_LOCK         ONE global write lock — the concurrent Crew's
                        agents can never mutate the world at the same
                        time (invariant I7)

Nothing a worker does pollutes the main conversation: each worker
collapses into a compact structured WorkerReport, and its lifecycle is
sealed as crew.* events in the log.
