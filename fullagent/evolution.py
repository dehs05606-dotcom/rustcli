"""EVOLUTION — the self-improvement engine for role briefs.

The agent gets better at its own job, mechanically:

    assess    each worker/team report carries a status (done/blocked/
              error) and tool-call counts; per ROLE, fitness is the
              trailing success rate over recent runs
    mutate    the weakest role's brief is rewritten by the model into
              K candidate variants (the mutator is INJECTABLE — the
              self-test evolves deterministically offline)
    evaluate  every candidate runs the SAME benchmark task as a real
              worker; the scorer grades the outcome deterministically
    select    the champion must beat the incumbent's score by a margin;
              ties keep the incumbent (no drift without evidence)
    deploy    the winner is registered through systemprompt.register()
              and re-sealed by the Mastermind vault on its next resolve
              — the deployment lineage is a sealed evolution.deployed
              event, and the full old text lives in the event log, so
              rollback is one command, forever auditable

Guardrails (mechanical, not advice):
  * only WORKER briefs evolve — 'main' and 'master' are never touched
  * at most ONE role evolves per generation
  * a failed evaluation never deploys anything
  * generations are capped per session (evolution is deliberate work)
