"""COUNCIL — multi-agent adversarial debate.

For high-stakes decisions, one opinion is not enough. The Council convenes
a structured debate over a question:

  * THESIS      — argues FOR the proposition.
  * ANTITHESIS  — argues AGAINST it, and must attack the thesis's weakest
                  point (not just restate a contrary view).
  * SYNTHESIS   — a blind judge: it sees ONLY the two arguments, never the
                  question's framing, never the speakers' identities, and
                  decides on argument strength alone. (Blind review is the
                  point — a judge that sees the defence is not a judge.)

The verdict is sealed as council.verdict with the winning side, the
deciding reason, and a confidence score. Positions are sealed as
council.position events, so every debate is replayable and auditable.

Design:
  * `speaker` produces one position: speaker(role, brief) -> str. In the
    agent it is bound to a model call through the Mastermind gate; in tests
    it is a stub. The council itself is deterministic orchestration.
  * Positions run one at a time (thesis, then antithesis) — no parallel
    subagents.
  * The synthesis prompt is built mechanically from the two positions and
    carries NO other context — the blindness is structural.
