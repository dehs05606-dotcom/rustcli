"""RACE — racing universes: first verified strategy wins.

One problem, N strategies, tried ONE AT A TIME in lane order (no
parallel subagents). Each universe pursues a different approach (role +
instructions); the moment one produces a result that passes the
verifier, it wins — every remaining lane is skipped and sealed as
cancelled. Losers' partial work is discarded by design: you bought
thoroughness, you paid the compute.

    strategies  default three lanes — the DIRECT lane (just do it),
                the CAREFUL lane (analyse first, then act), and the
                SPLIT lane (break the work into parts) — or supply
                your own
    race        lanes run serially; after each one lands the verifier
                (injectable — production uses the Judge) checks it
    finish      first PASS wins (race.winner); remaining lanes are
                sealed cancelled without ever running; if NOTHING
                passes, the best failure is returned with all
                universes' evidence (race.cancel)

The runner and verifier are injectable; the self-test races three
universe-runners with different speeds and proves: the fast-but-wrong
universe does NOT win, the verified one does, and the slowest is
cancelled before finishing.
